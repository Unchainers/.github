## 🚀 About Us

**Unchainers** from the Champions of CodeFest ICP Web3 Season 11 and dreams to go International!
We are a collective of developers, designers, dreamers, and doers who believe in reimagining how people **learn**, **work**, and **compete** in the digital age.

Formed through the development of our flagship platform — also called **StayChaintion** and **Overworked** — we aim to empower individuals and communities to take back control of their time, skills, and energy.

We create tools that are:
- 🌐 **Decentralized by design**
- 🧠 **AI-enhanced and human-first**
- 🎮 **Gamified, engaging, and rewarding**
- 💡 **Built for the future of work & learning**
